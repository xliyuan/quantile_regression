# quantile_regression
Real-world problems often extend beyond point forecast. Instead, uncertainty estimation, such as prediction intervals, or more generalic quantiles, are needed. Here, different quantile regressions from linear models to trees to deep learning are introduced and compared, with runnable jupyter notebook.
